introduction: >
  Hi! I'm Joseph who's passionate about languages and technologies.</br></br>
  The engineering ability to deliver robust projects that are well-designed, sufficiently-and-automatically-tested, clearly-documented within a reasonable amount of time is something I am always pursuing.</br></br>
  Currently, I am familiar with common Backend stacks(MySQL, Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, RESTful API, RPC, GraphQL) with Python-specific frameworks/libs(Asyncio, Flask, Huey, Pytest) as well as DevOps tools/services(Ansible, Terraform, CircleCI, Scalyr, Newrelic, Sentry, Pagerduty).</br></br>
  I also had experiences in building cross-platform apps using Flutter.</br></br>
  My next goal is to further sharpen my Backend Skills by exploiting Golang and K8s. I would also explore the possibility to full-stack myself with JavaScript-related stacks (Node.js, Deno.js, React.js)
